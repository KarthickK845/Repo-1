Spring Annotations
===================

@SpringBootApplication

@SpringBootConfiguration

@ComponentScan

@AutoConfiguration

@Component - stereotype annotation - like parent class
only for Spring Bean (Component class) identification

@Autowired - used for dependency injection
-injecting the dependencies - allows injecting object of a class into another class
-takes the object created in IOC container and provided to the code where object is needed

Example 

@component
class Freefire {
}

@component
class PubG {
}

@Autowired
Freefire obj;

@Autowired
PubG p;

@Primary add this annotation to the Spring Bean class which you consider as primary one.
It tells spring, please use the primary one as your first choice

@Qualifier mark this annotation where we used @Autowired and it finds two bean types (such as PubG and Freefire)
