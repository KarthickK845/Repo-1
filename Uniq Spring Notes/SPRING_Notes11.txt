To connect two applications or two services, we use RestTemplate class (its a third party class)
we can send request from one application to another using the methods inside RestTemplate class

We do not create object generally using "new" keyword in Spring as it automatically creates an object by Spring Container

@Bean
But if we need to create object for Third party class, we can create using @Bean method level annotation
that method returns a Spring Bean

Customizing Third Party Beans

to customize and config third party beans that you dont have control over

create a config class to define a bean of a third party library and config it with custom settings
 
@Configuration - class level annotation for Configuration class - when starting the application itself, it will help in creating the third part beans/objects (mostly used for this purpose)
-we can have more than one @Bean annotations inside a Config class

methods inside RestTemplate

getForObject for GET HttpMethod
-returns plain object

getForEntity
-returns full HTTP response

exchange method for POST HttpMethod, etc

@Nullable annotation requestEntity

Generics And Type Erasure
-Java uses a feature called Generics which allows you to specify the type in type-safe manner
-during runtime, Java uses process - Type Erasure

both List<Employee> and List<String> taken as just List at runtime

ParameterizedTypeReference
- allows to retain the generic

requestEntity - add required HTTP headers, security token, etc



ResponseEntity - returns complete HTTP response
