=> Database is the are to store the collection of information in a processed way - organized format
=> There are two types of database
1) DBMS - Database Management System
2) RDBMS - Relational Database Management System

DBMS is not secured as it allows data redundancy.
1 Hari 123

If we add info of Gokul of ID 1, it will replace Hari's info
1 Gokul 1234

RDBMS is secured as it does not allow data redundancy. By using constraints like Primary key, etc. RDBMS overcomes data redundancy issues.

In RDBMS, Normalization (Query optimization) is reducing query execution time by using index

DBMS - adding file, creating file done using ORM - Object Oriented Relational Mapping, So SQL is not used here.

DBMS - supported in MongoDB, Firebase

MySQL - open source, supports custom features
