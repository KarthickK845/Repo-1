Datatypes
=========
=> Datatypes are used to specify the size and the value for the columns. There are three types of datatypes.
i) Numeric datatype
ii) String datatype
iii) Date datatype

1) Numeric datatype
===================
i) int
ii) integer
iii) BigInt (is like Long type)
iv) double
v) decimal
vi) blob (Binary Large Object) - to store image file
vii) float

=> No need to mention size i.e. number of digits for these numeric types

2) String datatype
==================
i) char() - range less than 255 characters
ii) varchar() - range higher than 255  characters
iii) text(); - for higher range of characters and for special symbols
iv) tinytext(); - for special symbols

=> must mention the size/length
=> must use the value within single quotes

=>char() and varchar() stores each character like array

char(5)
=> static
=> fixed memory size
=> returns size as 5 for input value 'HI'
H | I |  |  |  |

varchar(5)
=> dynamic
=> releases extra memory
=> returns size as 2 for input 'HI'
H | I |  |  |  |

3) Date datatype
================
i) date - 'yyyy-mm-dd'
ii) time - HH:MM
iii) year - 'yyyy'
iv) datetime - 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM'
v) timestamp

=> if needed, we can change the format of date using dateformat() function

Constraints
===========
=> Constraints are a set of rules for columns in a table
=> Using constraints, we can restrict the user to avoid the data redundancy
=> There are seven types of constraints

i)not null
ii) unique
iii) primary key
iv) foreign key
v) check
vi) auto increment
vii) default

1) NOT NULL
===========
NOT NULL constraint restricts the user from entering null values. It allows n number of duplicate values.
Eg: can be used for Employee_Name column

2) UNIQUE
=========
UNIQUE constraint does not allow duplicate values but it allows n number of null values.
Eg: mobile number and email id columns

3) PRIMARY KEY
==============
PRIMARY KEY constraint is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints. So, it does not allow duplicate and null values.
Eg: Employee_ID
=> A table must have only one primary key column
=> collection of primary keys is known as composite key

4) FOREIGN KEY
==============
=> FOREIGN KEY is used to combine two or more tables
=> A table can have n number of foreign key columns but the foreign key column should act as primary key of another table.
=> provides permanent relationship between tables in RDBMS

5) CHECK
========
=> CHECK constraint is used to check the condition based on the values.
=> If it returns true, it will allow the record else it won't allow the record further.

6) AUTO INCREMENT
=================
=> AUTO INCREMENT is used to increment the value by one automatically when the record is inserted.
=> We can give auto increment constraint for only primary key column.

7) DEFAULT
==========
=> DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
=> Whenever a new record is inserted, default value will be automatically set in that column for that record.

In MySQL, technically :
Table is called as Entity
Column is called as Field
Row is called as Record
Data is called as Attributes

SQL Commands
============
=> Each SQL command is a level of access.

1) DDL - Data Definition Language - Entity level access
-> CREATE
-> ALTER
	-> ADD
	-> MODIFY
	-> RENAME
	-> DROP
-> DROP
-> TRUNCATE

2) DML - Data Manipulation Language - Record level access
-> INSERT
-> UPDATE
-> DELETE

3) DQL - Data Query Language
-> SELECT
-> ALIAS
-> DISTINCT
-> CALL

4) DCL - Data Control Language
-> GRANT
-> REVOKE

5) TCL - Transaction Control Language
-> COMMIT
-> ROLLBACK
-> SAVEPOINT
