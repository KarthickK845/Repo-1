FOREIGN KEY
===========
	QUERY
	------
	alter table emp add constraint foreign key(deptno) references dept(deptno);

=> adding foreign key constraint to deptno column in emp table.
=> We must mention 'references' to which primary key column of another table is it referring to. i.e. deptno primary key column of dept table.
=> When we retrieve the records using foreign key, it acts like 'Inner Join' only.
	
	QUERY
	------
	select emp.*,dept.* from emp,dept where emp.deptno=dept.deptno and emp.ename='smith';

=> We can match and retrieve the records like above only if the given tables have primary key-foreign key relationship.

	QUERY
	-----
	select emp.*,dept.*,dept2.* from emp,dep,dept2 where emp.deptno=dept.deptno and emp.deptno=dept2.deptno;

Transaction Control Language (TCL)
==================================
=> TCL is used to transact the records to the database.(or in other words, transaction the changes made in the database.)
=> TCL is mostly used to transact the DML queries.
=> DML queries are auto-commit by default. 
To switch off auto-commit => query is 
set autocommit=0;
To switch on auto-commit => query is 
set autocommit=1;

=> rollback is used to undo the query/changes that are temporarily saved in database.

=> commit query permanently saves the changes done upto last query in the database.

=> rollback after commit will not undo/remove the permanent changes from the database.

=> savepoint is used to store/save a group of data/records/changes under a name.

create table person(id int primary key,name char(30));
select * from person;

insert into person values(1,'Arun'),(2,'Bala'),(3, 'Chinnu');

savepoint a; --above 3 records stored in this savepoint a

insert into person values(4,'Chella'),(5,'Chinna'),(6, 'Naruto'); 

savepoint b; --above 6 records stored in b

insert into person values(7,'Veni'),(8,'Venu'),(9, 'Rani'); 

savepoint c; --above 9 records stored in c

rollback to b; --savepoint c will get deleted so only 6 records will be stored in database

rollback to a; --only 3 records will be stored

--rollback to savepoint will work only for temporary changes; if we commit, savepoints will be stored permanently

SELF JOIN TASKS

#1 WAQTD names of the employees, names of their managers.

select employee.ename as EmpName,manager.ename as MgrName from emp as employee, emp as manager 
where employee.mgr=manager.empno;

#2 WAQTD names of the employees, names of their managers and the names of manager's managers.

select employee.ename,manager1.ename,manager2.ename from emp as employee, emp as manager1, emp as manager2 
where employee.mgr=manager1.empno and manager1.mgr=manager2.empno;

Above gives output in the correct expected order and though there is slight difference, below query gives in different order.

select employee.ename,manager1.ename,manager2.ename from emp as employee, emp as manager1, emp as manager2 
where employee.empno=manager1.mgr and manager1.empno=manager2.mgr;
