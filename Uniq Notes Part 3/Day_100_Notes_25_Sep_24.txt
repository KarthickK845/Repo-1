RequestDispatcher
-----------------
=> RequestDispatcher is an interface.
=> It is used to send the same request (already sent by client) to another resource.
=> That another resource can be any file jsp,html or servlet etc.
=> It has two methods
---- 1. forward();
---- 2. include();

forward vs sendRedirect 

sendRedirect() - sends new request everytime
forward(),include() - sends over already existing request

forward() method cannot access response of servlet2 (access in other page only)
servlet2 response can be accessed by include (access in same page and other page)

client page eg. Login form
validate using Servlet 1

include() binds same page response and other page response

---- 1. forward();

It sends the same request to the another resource but it does not get the response back to the previous resources

---- 2. include();

It sends the same request to the another resource but it can get back the response from another resource to the previous resource

if(name.equals(cname)&& pass.equals(cpass)){
RequestDispatcher ref=request.getRequestDispatcher("Servlet2");	//sending the same request from current servlet to another servlet
ref.forward(request,response);
}
else{
out.println("Username or password is incorrect");
RequestDispatcher ref=request.getRequestDispatcher("login.jsp");
ref.include(request,response);	//binds the response of previous request and also response of current request
}

forward() - only returns the response of the last resource
include() - returns all the responses of last resource, current resource and previous resource if any
