Comparable and Comparator
==========================
Both are interfaces
We use these to sort the collection of objects

we have required methods to sort in Collections class

Arrays disadvantage - sort method we can sort only similar type of objects

Employee class

Comparable - provides single sort - we can sort based on only one value like name or id or job or salary in same class only
it provides compareTo() method with return type int for sorting - we can pass one object
it is in java.lang package
affects the original class as it sorts in the same single class
Collections.sort(list); => called in the same class which in turn calls compareTo() method by default
use when only user needs to sort in current class itself

public int compare(Student s1, Student s2)
{
return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
}

to ignore case of first letter

return a.name.compareToIgnoreCase(b.name);

Comparator - multi sort - we can sort based on multiple values name and id and job and salary from same class or different classes
it provides compare() method for sorting - we pass two objects
other method is equals() of Object class inside this interface
it is in java.util package
does not affect the original class
Collections.sort(list, class object); => class object of the class in which we have overridden the compare() method with sorting logic
use when other users are allowed to sort the objects from different classes 


TASK 
     Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

The Player class is provided for you in your editor. It has  2 fields: a name String and a score  integer.Given an array of  n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if  2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.
