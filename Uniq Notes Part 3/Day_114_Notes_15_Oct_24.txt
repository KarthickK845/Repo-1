Attributes:
In servlet attrbute is an object that can be set,get or remove from the scopes.
1.Request scope.
2.Session scope.
3.Application scope.

we can write java code directly in jsp page but we can't write in html page

Attributes object is used to pass some additional info to other servlet.It has some methods :
setAttribute()

* any page, any servlet can access the attributes object, so it is application level access
* we can set attributes only one time for an entire application
* we can use/get any number of times, from different servlets also

ServletContext class 
- getServletContext() method to create an object for ServletContext class
- setAttribute() method is used to set the values entered from server side

just like we need a default value or common value for a field for any user which we provide from the servlet side itself

HTML pge which gets name and password as inputs
on submit, the data entred should be passed to other servlet

We use doGet method which exposes the user information in URL



The difference of Attributes obj from Request dispatcher is that - only same sevlet can access the page

executequery used while using result set
only use when SELECT query is used

executeUpdate method while using preparedStatement
use for INSERT, UPDATE

We can perform CRUD operations using both Statement and PreparedStatement classes. But PreparedStatement is easy-to-use.

JDBC connectivity - INSERT operation performed

We can also set and get attributes using HttpSession class

HttpSession hs=request.getSession();
		hs.setAttribute(email, hs);
		hs.setAttribute(pincode, hs);
