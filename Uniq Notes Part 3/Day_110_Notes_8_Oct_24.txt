=======================================================================

Some learnings offline

* add method in Set,List returns boolean value. 

SET : If the value is already present in the Set, it returns false since Set does not allow duplicates. If not, it will add the new element and returns true.
LIST : add method of List returns true in both cases as List allows duplicates.

* why do we need private constructor
