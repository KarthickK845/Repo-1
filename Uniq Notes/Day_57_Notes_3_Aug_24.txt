transient keyword in Serialization

If we do not want to show/consider the value of a field which is private info, to the user during serialization/deserialization, declare that field as transient in the class to be serialized. 
The value shown to the user after deserialization will be default value of the type of that field.

Example : private info like password if declared in String, default value null will be shown after deserialization.

volatile keyword in multithreading

If the value of a variable common to two threads, needs to be used simultaneously after increment/decrement then declare that variable as volatile.

Hello all, today we had our project review which is built on Core Java concepts. We got to know about transient keyword in serialization and volatile keyword in multithreading. We revised some of the Java concepts.
