Access modifiers class - 2

if we use private in a constructor, we cannot create an object of that class inside another class

Ternary operator
? :

int a=9, b=10;
int result = (a>b) ? 5 : 11;
boolean res = (a<b) ? true : false;

instanceof operator
-checking if an object is of mentioned class type
- object_name instanceof class_name
-this method returns boolean value

Abc obj=new Abc();
boolean res = obj instanceof Abc;

TRY ONCE IN notepad++ and compile for both values - true and false

ENUM - later while teaching Non primitive types, Arrays, etc
Autobox, sandbox, wrapper classes - later after oops

OOPS - Object Oriented Programming

paradigm means methodology
Example C follows procedure based paradigm
Javascript follows object based paradigm. Does not support inheritance, polymorphism - CHECK THIS
C++,Java follows object oriented programming paradigm

4 concepts of OOPS
-> Abstraction
-> Encapsulation
-> Inheritance
-> Polymorphism

Class - is a logical entity, gives logical views, template of object
Object - is a physical entity, has state and behaviour, instance of class
Why java simple? - no explicit pointers, garbage collector, sandbox
Pointers - return memory address of a variable
Sandbox inside JVM- checks for files from untrusted sources; profile mechanism - checks if it affects locally

WHAT ARE JAVA TOOLS
WHERE JAVA
WHY JAVA

Task :
(1)
check if a number is duck number

user passes a number for ex.,
-> 3506, 3056, 3560 - duck number coz it has 0
-> 0356, 356 - not a duck number

(2)
check if a number is Tech number

user passes 2025
20|25 - split into two
20+25 = 45 - add both the splits
square of 45 should be equal to input number 2025
then 2025 is a Tech number
