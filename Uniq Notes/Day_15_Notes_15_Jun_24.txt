JVM, JRE, JDK - platform dependent - diff versions for diff OS
Java - platform independent

No complex concepts like Pointers in Java. So, its simple
bytecode is not human readable, so while transfering it to diff platform for execution, if it is hacked, hacker will not know the program but can only view the output. Only JVM can understand and convert bytecode into machine code. Hence it is Secure.

Polymorphism
============
A method can act in different ways
Poly means many
morphism means form
so, many forms.

Types :
=======
1) Compile time polymorphism or Overloading
2) Run time polymorphism or Overriding

Overloading
===========
-> can overload the method with same method name and passing different type of parameter or passing different number of parameter.
-> overloading is done in the same class.

Overriding
==========
-> can override the existing method with same return type, same method name and same parameters in different class.
