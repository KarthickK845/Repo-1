Types of Exceptions

Classes and subclasses

#REFER WRITTEN NOTES FOR ABOVE

Keywords :
-> try
-> catch
-> finally
-> throw
-> throws

Cannot give parent exception catch first and then the child classes; error will be thrown in compile time anyway, since that child catches will be unreachable blocks.

throw new ABCException() 
while using throw keyword with a compile time exception, it should be handled either using try..catch else using throws in the method signature. If not, error shown that the exception is not handled
But runtime exception is handled automatically

exception.SmallNumberException: Number is small -- print the message along with the exception
-> should pass the msg as a String argument to the constructor of the user-defined exception class
-> inside the user-defined exception class, parameterized constructor, call the super class parameterized constructor
-> pass the parameter as an argument to super class constructor call

throw new SmallNumberException("Number is small");
