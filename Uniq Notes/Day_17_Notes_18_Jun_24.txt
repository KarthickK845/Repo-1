Diff b/w return and non return types

value of local variable initialised inside a non return method cannot be taken outside the method. But with return type method, it can return the value and save it in another variable outside that method

Can we overload and override main method ?	## CHECK THIS

static method cannot be overridden since the memory is allocated during compile time. Same applies for main method as it is also static method.
static methods can be overloaded. Main method can be overloaded.
Overriding is run time.

Abstraction continues...
------------------------

2) Interface
============

-> similar to class - can have methods, variables but no constructors
-> 100% abstraction - we must have only abstract methods, cannot implement any method
-> all the methods are public abstract by default - all the methods that are declared inside interface
-> all the variables are public static final by default
-> we cannot just declare the variable in interface but must initialise it
-> using implements keyword
-> we can achieve multiple inheritance
-> we cannot create object for the interface

■ the method which is declared inside interface, we should specify access modifier as public for that method to implement inside the child class

■ If a class need to access members of parent class as well as the interface, we should give like below :
class A extends B implements C

should be in above order only
where B is parent class
C is interface

■ Multiple inheritance is achievable in Java using interfaces
class Homeloan implements Bank,Loan

where Bank and Loan are interfaces.
