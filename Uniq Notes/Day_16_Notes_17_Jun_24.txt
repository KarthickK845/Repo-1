Abstraction : 

-> Hiding the internal implementation and highlights the functionality to the user is known as abstraction.

Ways to achieve abstraction :

1) Abstract class
2) Interface

Abstract class :

-> Abstraction 1 to 100%
-> Abstract class can have both abstract method and non abstract methods
-> Using abstract keyword we can make a method as abstract method. If a class has any abstract method then the class also must be abstract.
-> We cannot create object for the abstract class
-> Must give the implementation for abstract method
-> Abstract method does not have method body
-> We cannot declare abstract method as private
