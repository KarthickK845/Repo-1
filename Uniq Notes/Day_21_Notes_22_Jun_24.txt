Array

-> Array is an object.
-> Collection of similar data stored in a single variable is known as array.
-> values are stored in contiguous memory.
-> Array size is fixed.
-> Array index starts from zero and length starts from one.
-> We can retrieve the values using index of the array.

Disadvantages of Array :
-> size is fixed. We cannot increase the size and it allows only similar type of values. We can overcome this problem using collections framework.

Array Tasks:
============
Input : 5 2 4 3 1 7
Output : 1 2 3 4 5 7

4 6 3 2 1
min value - 1
max value - 6

Get a value from user, check if it is available in the initialised array
If yes, print the given number is available. Else, no.
